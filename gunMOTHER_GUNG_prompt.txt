🧨 Vibe: Gangsta Grandma Energy + Explosive Memes

📦 Assets:
- Logo: logo.jpg
- Banner: banner.jpg
- Gallery: 1.jpg – 6.jpg

🎯 TASK FOR CURSOR:
Create a meme-heavy, hyper-animated landing page for $GUNG. The entire aesthetic is “dangerous grandma from the hood.” Gangsta fonts, chain bling, bullets, cigars, explosive transitions, boom-boom sound effects – go wild.

🧱 Website Structure:
1. **Fixed Header**
   - Left: logo.jpg
   - Right Nav:
     - "Why Grandma?"
     - "Lore"
     - "Roadmap"
     - "Buy $GUNG"

2. **Hero Section**
   - Fullscreen banner (banner.jpg)
   - Huge heading: “GUNS. GRITS. GRANDMA.”
   - Subtext: “Don’t talk back to Granny.”
   - Flashing CTA button: “BUY ON PUMPFUN”

3. **About Section**
   - Left: 1.jpg
   - Right: text (example):
     “You thought she was baking cookies. She was loading mags. $GUNG was born when one granny snapped during bingo night and decided to drop a memecoin with the same firepower she kept under her knitting table.”

4. **Gallery of Wrath**
   - Display all images (2.jpg – 6.jpg)
   - Each with hover animations + captions like:
     - “Don’t let the robe fool you – she’s packing heat.”
     - “Grandma’s aim? 100% on-chain.”
     - “Cigars and carnage. Just another Tuesday.”
     - “She doesn’t miss. She knits and hits.”

5. **Roadmap**
   - Q1: Bake sale fundraises the first LP.
   - Q2: Grandma buys a flamethrower.
   - Q3: Launches $GUNG. Targets soft rugs.
   - Q4: Shoots a TikTok music video in full camo.

6. **Lore Section (Click to Reveal)**
   - Big flashing button: “Who is gunMOTHER?”
   - Expands into an animated monologue from Granny herself:
     “Back in my day, we didn’t ask what tokens do. We asked who they do it *to*. I lost 3 husbands and a Degen wallet. Now I’m here to make you rich or bury you trying.”

7. **Footer**
   - Logo repeat
   - Warning: “Do not fade granny. Not financial advice.”
   - Twitter link (placeholder): [TWITTER]

🎨 Style Guide:
- Font: West side graffiti or Bangers-style
- Color Palette: deep reds, charcoal black, brass, neon green
- Animations: bounce, pop, glitch, flame bursts, AOS transitions
- Responsive but desktop-optimized
- Must make user feel like grandma will find them IRL if they fade this coin

🔥 Optional: Add graffiti tags that appear on scroll, “GRANDMA STRIKES BACK”, “BUY OR DIE”, “TAPES FROM NAM 1967”

Make it chaotic. Make it iconic. Let granny cook.
